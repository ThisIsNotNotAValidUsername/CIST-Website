                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This website was created to help new students ease into their stay at UNO. It is here to help new students get a look into how many resources are available at the University of Omaha and to give some 
                    important lessons and tips on how to be successful and thrive in University.

                <p style="margin: 50px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Managing your time in college can be stressful, with more assignments and said assignments being far more difficult, it can sometimes feel like it is very hard to complete them all on time. Maybe your
                    grades have started to fall because you can't keep up or perhaps you have had to sacrifice time you would play with your friends or relax for the sake of completing your homework.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 30px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are not alone in this feeling, and luckily there are a number of ways that can help you manage your time more effectively and get everything done without sacrficing your personal time.</p>
                <h2>1. &nbsp; Know what your assignments are</h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whenever you get a new assignment or have a moment to glance at your calendar, check what assignments are due and what those assignments are. If you know what they are, you can get an idea on how long it will take
                    for you to complete them, this will let you start your assignments so that you can get them done on time instead of finding out at the last minute that a particular assignment was far more in depth than you realised.
                </p>
                <h2>2. &nbsp; Designate yourself a 'School Time'</h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Take the time to make a schedule about your classes, work, and other obligations you have. Once you have done that, mark a little bit of time, whether thats 15 to 30 minutes or an hour, out of your day to work
                    on school. If you don't have school, spend a little bit of time working on a class your passionate about. Maybe that is doing a bit more on your art project or adding another function into a program you created. Whatever it is, spend a little bit
                    of time doing it. It will improve your skills in that class and it will get you into the habit of taking time out of your day to focus on school.
                </p>
                <h2>3. &nbsp; Don't overwhelm yourself</h3>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure that whenever you sign up for classes or decide on a project that you do not overwhelm yourself with work. Make sure that whatever assignments you may get you will have enough time to do them without
                    endless amounts of stress.

            <div id="menu_university_resources" style="display: none;">
                <h1 style="margin: 80px;">Resources at the University of Omaha Nebraska</h1>
                <h2>What are the resources available?</h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The University of Omaha offers countless resources for you to use covering everything from tutoring to help on essays, counseling, car problems, any much more. The greatest thing you can do at UNO to 
                    improve yourself and your time is to simply ask for help. Ask teachers, students, and most importantly check their website. I can almost guarantee that if you look up something along the lines of "Help with XXX University of Omaha Nebraska", 
                    you will get a link to some resource at UNO that can help you. The best part? It is already paid for by you. The moment you enroll in UNO you paid for these resources, so go use them!

                <h2>1. &nbsp; Bad time managment</h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the biggest mistakes I have made at my time in the University of Omaha is my endless procrastination. While I have yet to miss an assignment outright, I have had times where I did not complete an entire assignment and many
                    times where the assignment was turned in only minutes before they were due. While this has not been the greatest experience it has taught me to manage my time atleast slightly better. I am now doing assignments the day they are due rather than 5
                    minutes before. I may not be able to change my habits in a few months but thats ok. As long as you continue to improve, even if it is only a little bit, it is a step in the right direction that will benefit you greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>2. &nbsp; Keys in a locked car</h2>
                <p style="margin: 30px;">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I started school I had only begun driving for about a week or so. Because of this, I imagine it is no surprise that after a month and a half or so at UNO, I locked my keys in my car. This did lead to quite a bit of stress on my part, but it taught
                    me what I consider to be one of the most valuable lessons you can learn at UNO. You have resources. UNO gives you free (Well you already paid for it) resources that cover everything from tutoring, counseling, and luckily for me, getting your keys out of a locked car.
                    All I had to do was look up UNOs resources, call the number provided, and they sent someone to help get my door open. It taught me that if you ever struggle, there are people who will help at UNO, all you have to do is ask.
